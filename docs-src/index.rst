HypoFuzz documentation
======================

:pypi:`Hypothesis` is free and open-source software, and always will be.
It's proven itself invaluable for everyone - from students to high-school
teachers, astrophysicists to data scientists, web developers to systems
programmers, and even for hardware designers.

HypoFuzz builds on that success: if you have Hypothesis tests, HypoFuzz
gives you a fantastic way to spend CPU time - instead of engineering time -
to find bugs early in your development cycle.
